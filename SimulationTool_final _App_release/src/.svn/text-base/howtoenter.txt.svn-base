Polynomial functions
   -- maximum degree is three	
   -- should be entered in the simplified form that is a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d
      or -a*x^3 - b*x^2 - c*x - d or combination of pluses and minuses
   -- fractional coeffecient must be written as (p/q). Eg : (a/b)*x^2 + c

Log/Antilog functions
   -- should be of form g(x)*log(f(x)), where f(x)/g(x) can be x,x^2 or constant (>0, <0, fraction)
   -- same for antilog
   -- Eg : x*log(x^2)

exponential/Sin/Cosine functions
   -- must be of form e^(ax) 
   -- no other example/form is allowed
   -- similarly sin(ax) and cos(ax)
